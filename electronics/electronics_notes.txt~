### Foundation in Electronics

Current: Movement of electrons. Represents the flow of charge.
Voltage: Potential difference between two points.


Ohm's Law
---------

V = I * R    Voltage = Current * Resistance
I = V / R    Current = Voltage / Resistance
R = V / I    Resistance = Voltage / Resistance

Common terms
------------

Charge: measured in coulombs (C).
Current: measured in amps (A).
Energy: measured in Joules (J).
Power: rate of doing work.
Voltage: measured in volts (V).
