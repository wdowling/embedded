CMOS - Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor

On the TMC4C123 microcontroller powered with a 3.3V power supply. A voltage
between 2.145V and 5V is considered high, a voltage between 0V and 1.155V is
considered low. The microcontroller inputs and outputs also have a min and
max value for voltages.

Vil : Voltage Input Low
Vih : Voltage Input High
Vol : Voltage Output Low
Voh : Voltage Output High

P-Channel : signal sent from source to drain when voltage is positive.
N-Channel : signal sent from drain to source when voltage is positive.
